				    <p class="card-text indexText">I graduated from Hampden-Sydney College in 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science in Physics and minor in Mathematics.  As a research student, I taught myself a few programming languages including basic Python and HTML/CSS in order to systematize an end-to-end system that would monitor temperature and humidity levels. In the work place, I learned Ruby and Rails and MySQL. I became extremely intrigued with programming and enrolled in University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp where I am currently a student.  Thus far I have improved upon and added quite a few programming languages to my stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Git, Javascript, AJAX, Node.js, APIs, Express.js, and more. The course is three quarters complete and we still have a few more technologies to cover.</p>

				    <p class="card-text indexText">When I entered college, I thought for sure I would become an engineer. However, the summer before junior year, I had a change of heart and decided I wanted to be a pilot in the Marines. I attended Officer Candidate School in Quantico, VA the next summer, and came to the realization that the Marine life wasn't for me. Returning home, I graduated from college a semester early and immediately started working in the commercial real estate industry as an analyst. My position was geared to utilize my technical skillset where I am most passionate about learning. I spend a lot of my free time watching video tutorials or attempting new projects. When I am not coding, I enjoy playing sports and spending time by the ocean.</p>

				    <h4 class="card-title">Experience</h4>
				    <p class="card-text indexText">Since graduating, I have worked at a commercial real estate company in Richmond, VA as an analyst, also known as "the tech guy." I have built a Ruby on Rails application to keep track of investor information in addition to making changes to our websites as requested.  I have also gained familiarity with tools such as SQL server and basic Python. I was recently promoted to an Associate Asset Manager where my responsibilities include financial modeling, investor communication, and lender requests.  Outside of work, I have taken on a few group projects per the coding bootcamp's curriculum which can be found on the portfolio page. My passion lies with programming and developing and I take every opportunity I can to put my skills to work.</p>
